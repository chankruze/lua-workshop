--[[ # Order of operations

The general rules of the order of operations are simple:
(1) first operations in parentheses inside out,
(2) then multiplication and division left to right,
(3) then addition and subtraction also left to right.

This means that the expression `1+(4-2)*3` will be calculated with these steps:
- operation in parentheses will be done first (rule 1): `1+(2)*3`
- then multiplication (rule 2): `1+6`
- and finally addition (rule 3): `7`
